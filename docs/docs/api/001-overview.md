# Overview

## Layers

`NLUX` is a highly customizable and fully featured conversational AI UI library with 2 main layers:

* **[The User Interface Layer](/api/ui)** 🎨 — Which is responsible for `everything that gets rendered` on the
  screen, such as
  the conversation component, the prompt input, the streaming of AI responses back to the user, and so on.
* **[The Adapters Layer](/learn/adapters)** 🔌 — Which enables the `integration with several AI backends`, by handling API calls,
  and response streaming. Iy allows for `custom adapters` to be built for any backend.

## Platforms

`NLUX` is available in 2 flavors:

* **`NLUX` React JS** ⚛️ — Which is a React JS implementation that includes React components and hooks.
* **`NLUX` Javascript** 🟨 — A pure Javascript library that can be used with any web framework such as Angular or Vue.

You'll find a toggle at the top of each documentation page that allows switching between the 2 platforms.
