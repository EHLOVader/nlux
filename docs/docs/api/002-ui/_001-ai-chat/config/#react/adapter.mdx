The adapter is a required property.<br />
It's responsible for connecting `NLUX` to the AI backend of your choice.

The value can be:<br />
* A `StandardChatAdapter` — one of `NLUX`'s [standard adapters](/api/adapters), imported from `@nlux/<adapter>-react` packages.<br />
* A [custom adapter](/learn/adapters/custom-adapters) — that implements the `Adapter` interface.<br />
* An `AdapterBuilder` — the result of calling an adaptor creator function like `createChatAdapter()`.

> * Required
> * Type: `ChatAdapter` | `StandardChatAdapter` | `ChatAdapterBuilder`
