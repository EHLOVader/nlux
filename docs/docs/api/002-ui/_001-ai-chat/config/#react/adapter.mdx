The adapter is a required property. It's responsible for providing the adapter used to connect `NLUX` to the AI backend
of your choice.

The value can be:<br />
* A `StandardChatAdapter` — one of `NLUX`'s standard adapters, imported from `@nlux/<adapter>-react` packages.<br />
* A custom adapter — that implements the `Adapter` interface.<br />
* An `AdapterBuilder` — the result of calling a hook like `useChatAdapter()`.

Adapters are generic types. **The default type for `AiMsg` is `string`**, but when the expected AI message type returned
is an object, you can provide the exact type of that object as a generic argument.

> * Type: `ChatAdapter<AiMsg>` | `StandardChatAdapter<AiMsg>` | `ChatAdapterBuilder<AiMsg>`
> * Required
> * Usage

```jsx
<AiChat adapter={myAdapter} />
```
