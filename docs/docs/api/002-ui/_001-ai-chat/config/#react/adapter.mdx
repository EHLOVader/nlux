The adapter is a required property. It can be either an instance of an adapter or an adapter builder, and it
is used to connect `NLUX` to the AI backend of your choice.

The value can be:
Either an `AdapterBuilder`, which is what you get when you use the **standard** adapters by `NLUX`,
such as `useChatAdapter()` from `@nlux/openai-react` â€• Or an instance that implements the `Adapter` interface,
which is what you should provide when you build your own custom adapter.

* Type: `Adapter` | `AdapterBuilder`
* Required
* Usage

```jsx
<AiChat adapter={myAdapter} />
```
