By default, `NLUX` expects each message received from AI to be a string.<br />
However, for advanced use cases where an object is expected, a generic type can be provided to the `AiChat` component.<br />

| | Default<br />Without Generic Type | Advanced<br />With Generic Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **JSX Syntax** | `<AiChat ... />` | `<AiChat<AiResponseType> ... />`<br />where `AiResponseType` is a custom type |
| **AI Reponse Expected** | `string` | Object matching the `AiResponseType` type |
| **Use Case** | Text or markdown generated by an LLM | An AI system that generates an object or a stream of objects |
| **Rendering** | The string response will parsed as markdown | For **standard adapters**, `NLUX` handles conversion to markdown. For custom adapters, `a custom renderer` is required, otherwise the object will be displayed stringified. |

> For most of the use cases, the default behavior is sufficient.<br />
> The advanced use case is for custom components with complex AI responses.<br />
