In order to remove an event listener, you can simply update the object passed to `events` property of `<AiChat />`
component. For example, if you want to remove the `messageReceived` event listener, you can pass a new object that
does not contain the `messageReceived` key:

```jsx
<AiChat
    adapter={myAdapter}
    events={{
        messageSent: (message: string) => console.log(message),
    }}
/>
```

Whenever the `events` property is updated, `<AiChat />` component will automatically remove the previous event listeners
and add the new ones.

If you want to **remove all event listeners**, you can simply remove the `events` property:

```jsx
<AiChat adapter={myAdapter} />
```
