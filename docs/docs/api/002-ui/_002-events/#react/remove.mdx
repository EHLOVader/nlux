In order to remove an event callback, you can simply update the object passed to `events` property of `<AiChat />`
component. For example, if you want to remove the `messageSent` event listener, you can pass a new object that
does not contain the `messageSent` key:

```jsx
import {useCallback} from 'react';
import {AiChat, EventsMap, MessageReceivedCallback} from '@nlux/react';

// We define an event callback using the `useCallback` hook
const messageReceivedCallback: MessageReceivedCallback = useCallback((event) => {
    console.log('Message received:', event.message);
}, [/* Your callback code dependencies */]);

const eventCallbacks: EventsMap<string> = {
    messageReceived: messageReceivedCallback,
    // We remove the messageSent event listener by not including it in the object
};

<AiChat adapter={adapter} events={eventCallbacks} />
```

Whenever the `events` property is updated, `<AiChat />` component will automatically remove the previous event listeners
and add the new ones.

If you want to **remove all event listeners**, you can simply remove the `events` property:

```jsx
<AiChat adapter={adapter} />
```
