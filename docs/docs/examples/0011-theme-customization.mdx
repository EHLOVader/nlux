# Theme Customization

---

`NLUX` comes with 2 themes: `nova` and `unstyled`.<br />
You can use `CSS` to customize the themes to match your brand or design requirements.

In the example below, we changed the following details in the `unstyled` theme:

* Component background color set `#060524` (Dark blue)
* Assistant message background color set to `#5F9EA0` (Cadet blue)
* User message background color set to `#DC143C` (Crimson)
* Border radius set to `5px`
* Send icon replaced with a custom SVG icon.

We also set the `conversationOptions`'s layout to `bubbles` to display the messages in a bubble layout.

<CodeEditor
    files={{
        'App.tsx': app,
        'theme-overrides.css': customCss,
        'personas.tsx': personas,
        'send.ts': send,
    }}
    editorHeight={380}
    simulatedPrompt={'Do you think we could have a thoughtful debate about physics with ChatGPT?'}
/>
