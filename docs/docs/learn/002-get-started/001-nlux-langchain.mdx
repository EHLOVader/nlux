# Get Started â€• NLUX And LangChain

[LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) is popular framework for building services and backends powered by LLMs.
It offers a library called [LangServe](https://www.langchain.com/langserve) that exposes a REST API for interfacing
with LLMs.

This guide shows you how to get started with _NLUX_ and conversational AI APIs from LangServe.

---

_NLUX_ is available as a React JS component and hooks, or as a JavaScript library.<br />
The features are identical for both platforms.
Use the version that best suits your needs.
