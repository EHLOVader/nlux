Now that we have the _nlbridge_ adapter, we will create the chat component and pass the adapter to it.

```tsx
import {AiChat} from '@nlux/react';
import {useChatAdapter, ChatAdapterOptions} from '@nlux/nlbridge-react';

const adapterOptions: ChatAdapterOptions = {
    url: 'http://localhost:8080/chat-api',
};

export const App = () => {
    const nlbridgeAdapter = useChatAdapter(adapterOptions);

    return (
        <AiChat
            adapter={nlbridgeAdapter}
            composerOptions={{
                placeholder: 'How can I help you today?'
            }}
        />
    );
};
```

The `AiChat` component can take several parameters:

* The first parameter `adapter` is the only required parameter, and it is the adapter that we created earlier.
* The second parameter that we provide here is an object that contains the composer options. In this case, we are
passing a placeholder text `placeholder` to customize the composer.
