Now that we have the HF Inference API adapter, we will create the chat component and pass the adapter to it.

```tsx
import {AiChat} from '@nlux/react';
import {useChatAdapter, ChatAdapterOptions} from '@nlux/hf-react';

const adapterOptions: ChatAdapterOptions = {
    endpoint: '<YOUR ENDPOINT URL>',
    authToken: '<YOUR AUTH TOKEN FOR PROTECTED ENDPOINT>',
};

export const App = () => {
    const hfAdapter = useChatAdapter(adapterOptions);

    return (
        <AiChat
            adapter={hfAdapter}
            composerOptions={{
                placeholder: 'How can I help you today?'
            }}
        />
    );
};
```

The `AiChat` component can take several parameters:

* The first parameter `adapter` is the only required parameter, and it is the adapter that we created earlier.
* The second parameter that we provide here is an object that contains the composer options. In this case, we are
passing a placeholder text `placeholder` to customize the composer.

For full documentation on how to customize the `AiChat` component, please refer to the [AiChat documentation](/api/ui/ai-chat).
