# Generative UIs, Vercel AI, and NLUX RSC Adapter

In this guide, you will learn about **React Server Components**, **Generative User Interfaces** (in the context of
Vercel AI), how NLUX supports those features, and how to use them to build an AI-powered rich chat interface.

## What Are Generative UIs?

Generative User Interfaces (UIs) are a new paradigm in web development that allows developers to create dynamic and
interactive user interfaces using AI-generated content. One of the pioneer projects in this space is
[v0](https://vercel.com/blog/announcing-v0-generative-ui), by Vercel, which enables developers to build UIs using
natural language prompts.

While the success of v0 has been limited, the concept has gained traction in the frontend developers community.<br />
Today, the production-ready version of Generative UIs is less about generating UIs from scratch using natural language
prompts and more about using AI to pre-fill UI components with data. This feature was introduced in
[Vercel AI SDK](https://vercel.com/blog/ai-sdk-3-generative-ui) and is now supported by NLUX.

## What Are React Server Components?
React Server Components are a new feature in React that allows developers to render HTML an HTML representation on the
server and send it to the client in a serialized form that can be interpreted in the browser and rendered as a part of
React component tree.

Combining Generative UIs with React Server Components allows developers to create rich and interactive React Components
on the server-side using AI-generated content.

## Where Does NLUX Come In?
`NLUX` is a library that simplifies the process of building AI-powered conversational interfaces. It provides a set of
adapters that allow developers to connect their chat UIs to different AI services and models.

In the context of Generative UIs and React Server Components, `NLUX` provides an adapter that allows developers to use
React Server Components as chat responses. This means that when a user sends a message to the chatbot, the response can
be a React component generated by an AI model, rather than a simple text message or markdown.
