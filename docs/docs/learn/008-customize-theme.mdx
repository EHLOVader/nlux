# Theme Customization

## Overriding Theme Variables

If you like to customize `NLUX`'s theme, you can override the Nove theme's variables simply by adding a new CSS
file in your web app or site that defines new values for those variables, and that has higher specificity than the
theme CSS.

## Variables To Override

You can find all **Novo theme variables** that can be overridden in the following files on GitHub:
* [`colors.css`](https://github.com/nluxai/nlux/blob/f088801ae10d63b2b334b56dc0a2e127013700ba/packages/css/themes/src/nova/colors.css) All the colors
that can be overridden.
* [`variables.css`](https://github.com/nluxai/nlux/blob/f088801ae10d63b2b334b56dc0a2e127013700ba/packages/css/themes/src/nova/variables.css) All the other
variables that can be overridden, including font size and family, border radius, etc.

You don't have to re-build a new version of `NLUX` to override the theme variables. As shown in the example above,
you can simply add a new CSS file and override the variables inside a CSS selector that has higher specificity than
the default theme selector.

## Example

In the example below, we are overriding 2 aspects of the `Nova` theme:

* Changing the primary color to `#1f6adb` (blue)
* Changing the border radius of inputs to `0px`

The button and the sent messages will be blue, and the input will have sharp corners:

<CodeEditor
    files={{
        'App.tsx': exampleJsxFileAiChatBot,
        'custom-nova-theme.css': exampleCssPersonasConfig,
        'personas.tsx': exampleJsxPersonasConfig,
        'adapter.ts': exampleJsxFileStreamAdapter,
    }}
    editorHeight={380}
    simulatedPrompt={'Do you think we could have a thoughtful debate about physics with ChatGPT?'}
/>

Try updating `custom-nova-theme.css` and see the changes in the chatbot above.

### Explanation

In order to change the primary button color to `#1f6adb` (blue). We created a new file called `custom-nova-theme.css`
and add the following CSS:

```css
.custom-ai-chat-comp.nluxc-root.nluxc-theme-nova {
    --nluxc-button-background-color: #1f6adb;
    --nluxc-button-border-color: #1f6adb;

    --nluxc-button-active-background-color: #3474d3;
    --nluxc-button-active-border-color: #3474d3;
}
```

The default theme variables are defined under `.nluxc-root.nluxc-theme-nova` selector, so you need to make sure that
your CSS selector has higher specificity than that.

:::tip Important
Notice that in this example, we added a CSS selector `.custom-ai-chat-comp` **to increase the specificity** of the
variables we are overriding. This selector was added as a `className` in `App.tsx` and as part of the CSS selector
in `custom-nova-theme.css`.
:::

Then, you can add the following to your HTML file:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./custom-nova-theme.css" />
```

or if you are using a bundler that's configured to load CSS, you can just import the CSS file in your JSX/TSX file:

```js
import './custom-nova-theme.css';
```
