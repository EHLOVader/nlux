# UI Overrides

`NLUX` is simply yet very flexible to use. We allow customization via
<Link to="/reference/ui/ai-chat">config options</Link>.
We provide a powerful <Link to="/ui/themes">theming system</Link>. We also allow React JS developers to override
some of the default UI components in the AI chat area.

This reference page details how to override the default UI components in the AI chat area, and the possible overrides
that you can make.

## Usage

You can override the JSX/HTML of certain UI components by passing a custom container component to the `AiChat` component
with your JSX elements inside it.

Here is an example of how you can override loader component displayed across multiple parts of NLUX:

```jsx
import {AiChat} from '@nlux/react';
import {AiChatUI} from '@nlux/react';
import {useChatAdapter} from '@nlux/<platform>-adapter'; // Or use a custom adapter

const MyAiChatApp = () => {
    const myAdapter = useChatAdapter({ /* Your adapter options */ });
    return (
        <AiChat adapter={myAdapter}>
            <AiChatUI.Loader>
                <span className="rounded">Loading ðŸ‘»</span>
            </AiChatUI.Loader>
        </AiChat>
    );
};
```

The inner JSX element `<AiChatUI.Loader><span className="rounded">Loading ðŸ‘»</span></AiChatUI.Loader>` will instruct
`NLUX` to replace the default loader component with the custom loader component provided as a child:

```jsx
<span className="rounded">Loading ðŸ‘»</span>
```

## UI Overrides Supported

Below is a list of UI component overrides that are currently supported:

---

> ### Loader

This enables overriding the loading spinner displayed in 2 locations:

* Inside the default submit button, when it's in a loading state.
* Under a message, when it's being loaded from the server or streaming.

> * Overriding Container: `AiChatUI.Loader`
> * Usage:

```jsx
<AiChat adapter={myAdapter}>
    <AiChatUI.Loader>
        <span className="rounded">Loading ðŸ‘»</span>
    </AiChatUI.Loader>
</AiChat>
```

## Adding More Overrides

We will be adding more customization options and overrides as we receive feedback from the community.

If your project requires more customization options, **please let us know** by:

* Either opening an issue on the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/nlkitai/nlux/discussions) page
* Or by simply suggesting it in the [NLUX Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/SRwDmZghNB)

UI overrides only support React components at the moment.
