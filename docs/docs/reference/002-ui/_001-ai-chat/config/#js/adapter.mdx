The adapter is a required property.<br />
It's responsible for connecting `NLUX` to the AI backend of your choice.

The `withAdapter(adapter)` method is used to provide the adapter to the `AiChat` component.

The value can be:<br />
* A `StandardChatAdapter` — one of `NLUX`'s [standard adapters](/reference/adapters), imported from `@nlux/[adapter]-react` packages.<br />
* An `AdapterBuilder` — the result of calling an adaptor creator function like `createChatAdapter()`.
* A [custom adapter](/learn/adapters/custom-adapters) — that implements the `ChatAdapter` interface.<br />
