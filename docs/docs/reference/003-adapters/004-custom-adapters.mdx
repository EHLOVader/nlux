# Custom Adapters

If you're building your own APIs and you would like to use `NLUX` as the UI for your own AI chatbot,
you can do so by creating a custom adapter.

There are 2 types of custom adapters that you can create:

* Streaming Adapters
* Batch Adapters

---

## Streaming Adapters

Streaming adapters are used when the API sends responses in a stream (e.g. WebSockets, or Server-Sent Events).

The advantage of using a streaming adapter is that **the chat UI will be updated in real-time while the LLM is still
generating text**. This is particularly useful if the API takes a long time to process a request and sends responses
in a stream. Most major LLM APIs (e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic) support streaming responses.

In order to implement a custom streaming adapter for `NLUX`, you need to implement the following interface:

```tsx
interface ChatAdapter<AiMsg = string> {
    streamText: (
        message: string,
        observer: StreamingAdapterObserver<AiMsg>,
        extras: ChatAdapterExtras<AiMsg>,
    ) => void;
}
```

The `streamText` method takes 2 parameters:

* `message` - The prompt message typed by the user, to be sent to the API.
* `observer` - An observer that will receive the responses from the API and pass them to `NLUX`.
* `extras` - An object containing [additional information](#adapter-extras) that the adapter might need.

Below is the definition of the `StreamingAdapterObserver` interface:

```tsx
interface StreamingAdapterObserver<ChunkType = string> {
    next: (chunk: ChunkType) => void;
    error: (error: Error) => void;
    complete: () => void;
}
```

You can call the `next` method of the observer as responses are received from the API.
The `complete` method should be called when the API has finished sending responses, and
The `error` method should be called if an error occurs.

## Batch Adapters

Batch adapters can be used when the API sends responses in a single request without streaming.<br />
Batch adapters are ** easier to implement**.

In order to implement a batch promise adapter for `NLUX`, you need to implement the following interface:

```tsx
interface ChatAdapter<AiMsg = string> {
    batchText: (
        message: string,
        extras: ChatAdapterExtras<AiMsg>,
    ) => Promise<AiMsg>;
}
```

The `batchText` method takes 1 parameter:

* `message` - The prompt message typed by the user, to be sent to the API.
* `extras` - An object containing [additional information](#adapter-extras) that the adapter might need.

The `batchText` method should return a promise that resolves to the response from the API.

## Adapter Extras

The `ChatAdapterExtras` object passed as last parameter to the `batchText` and `streamText` methods contains
information that the adapter might need. It has the following properties. It has the following properties:

```tsx
interface ChatAdapterExtras<AiMsg = string> {
    // The props that were passed to the AiChat component
    aiChatProps: AiChatPropsInEvents<AiMsg>;

    // The conversation history
    // Available when `conversationOptions.historyPayloadSize`
    // is set to a value greater than 0 or to `'max'`
    conversationHistory?: ChatItem<AiMsg>[];

    // This contains the headers that implementers can use to send additional data such as authentication headers.
    headers?: Record<string, string>;
}
```

The `ChatItem` type is defined as follows:

```tsx
export type ChatItem<AiMsg = string> = {
    role: 'assistant';
    message: AiMsg;
    serverResponse?: string | object | undefined;
} | {
    role: 'user';
    message: string;
} | {
    role: 'system';
    message: string;
};
```
