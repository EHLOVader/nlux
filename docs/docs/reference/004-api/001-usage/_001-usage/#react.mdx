The `useAiChatApi()` hook is used to create an instance of the `AiChatApi` object. This object is used to interact with
the chatbot UI, such as sending messages, getting the chat history, and more.

```tsx
const api = useAiChatApi();
```

Once created, the `api` object can be passed to the `AiChat` component as a prop, and its methods can be called to
interact with the AiChat UI.

```tsx
<AiChat api={api} adapter={adapter} />
```
