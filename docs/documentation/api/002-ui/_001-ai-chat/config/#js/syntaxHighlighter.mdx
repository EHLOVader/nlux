The syntax highlighter is an optional extension that can be used to highlight the source code blocks that
are generated by the LLM. When no syntax highlighter is provided, the source code blocks will be rendered as plain text,
with mono-spaced font, and minimum styling.

If you expect your chatbot to be used to generate source code examples, you should consider using a syntax highlighter.

`nlux` provides a syntax highlighter that uses [Highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/).<br />
You can use it by installing `@nlux/highlighter` and passing it to the `syntaxHighlighter` prop as shown below.

You can also use your own syntax highlighter by implementing the `HighlighterExtension` interface.

* Type: `HighlighterExtension`
* Optional
* Usage

```javascript
import {highlighter} from '@nlux/highlighter';

const aiChat = createAiChat()
    .withSyntaxHighlighter(highlighter)
```
