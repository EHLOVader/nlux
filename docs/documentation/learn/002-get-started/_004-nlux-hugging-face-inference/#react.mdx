# nlux + React JS

This guide will walk you through the steps to add _nlux_ conversational capabilities to a React JS app.<br />
It assumes that you already have a React JS app set up.

If you don't have a React JS app set up yet, and you are looking for a quick way to get started, you can use
[Vite's `react-ts` template](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project) to quickly set up a React JS app.

<details>
    <summary>Set up a React JS project with vite</summary>
    <div>
        Use the following `npm` commands to set up a React JS app with Typescript using Vite's `react-ts` template:
        ```
        npm create vite@latest my-ai-chat-app -- --template react-ts
        cd my-ai-chat-app
        npm install
        npm run dev
        ```
    </div>
    The last command will start the development server and open the app in your default browser.
