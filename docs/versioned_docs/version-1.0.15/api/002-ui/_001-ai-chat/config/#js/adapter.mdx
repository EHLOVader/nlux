The `withAdapter` method is used to provide the adapter to the `AiChat` component.
The adapter is a required property. It can be either an instance of an adapter or an adapter builder, and it
is used to connect `nlux` to the AI backend of your choice.

The value can be:
Either an `AdapterBuilder`, which is what you get when you use the **standard** adapters by `nlux`,
such as `createChatAdapter()` from `@nlux/openai` â€• Or an instance that implements the `Adapter` interface,
which is what you should provide when you build your own custom adapter.

* Type: `Adapter | AdapterBuilder`
* Required
* Usage:

```javascript
const aiChat = createAiChat().withAdapter(myAdapter);
```
