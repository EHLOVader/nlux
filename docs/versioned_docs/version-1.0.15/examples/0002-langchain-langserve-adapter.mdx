# LangChain LangServe Adapter

[LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) is a new and popular framework for building services powered by
Large Language Models. It enables applications that are context-aware. It also provides a library called
[LangServe](https://python.langchain.com/docs/langserve) to create standardized APIs that can be used to
interact with LangChain runnables.

This example illustrates how to use `nlux` to connect to a LangChain runnable made available through LangServe.

This example focuses on the frontend integration between LangServe and `nlux`. If you are interested in seeing
the backend code that enabled this demo, you can check this [repository](https://github.com/nluxai/pynlux),
which contains Python LangServe API code.
