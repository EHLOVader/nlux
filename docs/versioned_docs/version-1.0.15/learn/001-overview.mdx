Welcome to the _nlux_ learning resources.
This section provides detailed guides and examples to help you master building
conversational AI interfaces powered by _nlux_.

# Overview

_nlux_ is an open-source JavaScript library for **creating elegant and performant conversational user interfaces**.
It provides a vanilla JavaScript API as well as React JS components and hooks to integrate chatbot capabilities
into your web apps and websites with minimal effort.

The library's mission is to enable developers to quickly build interactive conversational experiences by handling all
the complexities behind the scenes. You can connect it to AI backends like ChatGPT or build your own custom adapters.

```
