# Get Started â€• nlux And LangChain

[LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) is popular framework for building services and backends powered by LLMs.
It offers a library called [LangServe](https://www.langchain.com/langserve) that exposes a REST API for interfacing
with LLMs.

This guide shows you how to get started with _nlux_ and conversational AI APIs from LangServe.

_nlux_ is available as a React JS component and hooks, or as a Javascript library.<br />
The features are identical for both platforms.
