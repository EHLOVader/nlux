You can use the `useChatAdapter` hook to create a LangServe adapter.<br />
You can optionally import `ChatAdapterOptions` from `@nlux/nlbridge-react` to define the type of the options object.

```tsx
import {useChatAdapter, ChatAdapterOptions} from '@nlux/nlbridge-react';

const adapterOptions: ChatAdapterOptions = {
    url: 'http://localhost:8080/chat-api',
};

export const App = () => {
    const nlbridgeAdapter = useChatAdapter(adapterOptions);
}
```

The `ChatAdapterOptions` interface has one required property: `url`.
This is the URL of the _nlbridge_ endpoint that the adapter should connect to.

In this example, we are connecting the endpoint created in the previous section.
